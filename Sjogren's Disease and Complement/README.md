# Exploring Changes in Complement Expression in Sjogren's Disease-affected Human Salivary Glands

## Details
- Sjögren's Disease (SjD) is a systemic autoimmune disease without a clear etiology or effective therapy. Utilizing unbiased single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to analyze human minor salivary glands in health and disease we developed a comprehensive understanding of the cellular landscape of healthy salivary glands and how that landscape changes in SjD patients. This study explores the complex interplay of varied cell types in the salivary glands and their role in the pathology of Sjögren's Disease.

- No data needs to be collected
    - Study done using publically available data from CellxGene Census

## Goals
- Compare Sjogren's Diesease complement RNA expression vs normal using the 'scRNA-seq and spRNA-seq' data
- Show visual differential expression in the spRNA-seq
- Understand which cells are specifically affected
- Understand the changes in complement regulation
- Build on https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7792541/
    - This paper only did IHC staining
    - This approach would expand by looking for a host more genes
    - More robust dataset
    - Results found here may be suplemented by the same IHC methods

---
## Rationale
- Lab published a Sjogern's paper last year
- New technique with very few papers making use of it
- Data already available
- Using CellxGene Visual Explorer found obvious and dicernable changes between diseased and normal tissue complement expression levels

---
## Potential Problems
- Absolutely no experience working with either type of data
- Computing power
